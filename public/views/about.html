<h1>About StudyBuddy</h1>
<p>
  All too often, it can be difficult to to find a place to study, either by yourself or in a group. Our app targets students and young professionals who work outside their house and office and gives them a tool to find the best places to get stuff done. Using Yelpâ€™s API to target criteria like venue size, noise levels and parking availability, our app streamlines the process so users can filter the results found in their area to find a study venue that best suits their needs. Our goal is to collect user input to provide the best app to find your new favorite study spot. As the site grows we see it becoming a sharing and organizing platform for group projects, where you can coordinate meetup times and locations, share Trello boards, Google documents, and more.
